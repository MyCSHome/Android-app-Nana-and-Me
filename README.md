My girlfriend and I co-developed an Android app, Nana&Me.
The app was developed to help people evaluate their health and exercise conditions. 
Keywords: Android, OOP, machine learning, client&server, multi-threading, fantastic GUI design(from my gf). 

Only part of the entire codebase is listed here. The app hasn't been published on Google Play. 
If you want to try a full version on your phone, please contact me. :)
